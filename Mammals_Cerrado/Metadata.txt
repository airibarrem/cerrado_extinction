# Pattern of the file's name: "species_sdm_time.asc", where species is the name of the mammal species, sdm is the name of the method used to model the species' distribution (menv, mest and mml) and time is the time of the prediction ("p" and "f").

# time
p: prediction in the present time.
f: prediction in the future time (2050).

# sdm
menv: Frequency of projection from the Ensemble of the envelope methods or distance methodS, BIOCLIM, Euclidian and Gower distances. 
mest: Ensemble of the Statistical methods, Generalized Linear Models (GLM), Generalized Additive Models (GAM) and Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines (MARS).
mml: Ensemble of the machine-learning methods, Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt), Random Forest, and Genetic Algorithm for Rule Set Production (GARP).

# Resolution: 0.1º x 0.1º

# Predictors: Bios 1, 2, 4, 12, 15 and 19 and landuse in the present time from IBAMA and model of landuse to the future (2050) from Faleiro et al. (2013).

# GCMs in 2050: CCCMA_CGCM2, CSIRO-MK2.0 and UKMO_HADCM3 of the B2a emission scenario.

# Methods: First we predict the species distribution with the methods above and after we ‘filtered/corrected’ each species’ frequency of projection map by the presence of the species’ habitat (i.e. type of vegetation cover) in the cell.
